#IMPORTANT NOTICE:
#the program definitely works, however the 3rd and 5th link were faulty (at least on my device)
#when I opened the 3rd link directly to see the image, i got a blank image back.
#when i opened the 5th link directly, I was blocked from accessing the site as the connection was not private
#in order to make sure that the code does truly work, I would recommend swapping out the image links in the csv file for some other images
